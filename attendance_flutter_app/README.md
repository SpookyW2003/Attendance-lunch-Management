- User authentication (`/auth/login`)
- Token verification (`/auth/verify`)
- User data retrieval

## Development

### Running in debug mode
```bash
flutter run --debug
```

### Running in release mode
```bash
flutter run --release
```

### Building for specific platform

flutter build apk --release

# Android App Bundle (for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend connection failed**: Ensure the Node.js backend is running on port 5000
2. **Dependencies issues**: Run `flutter pub get` to reinstall packages
3. **Build issues**: Run `flutter clean` then rebuild

### Network Configuration

For testing on physical devices, update the `baseUrl` in `lib/services/auth_service.dart`:

```dart
// Change from localhost to your computer's IP address
static const String baseUrl = 'http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:5000/api';
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Biometric authentication
- [ ] Offline mode support
- [ ] Real-time notifications
- [ ] QR code attendance scanning
- [ ] Geofencing for attendance
- [ ] Photo capture for attendance
- [ ] Report generation
- [ ] Dark mode support

## Support

For issues and support, check:
1. Backend server is running
2. All dependencies are installed
3. Flutter SDK is properly configured
4. Device/emulator has internet connectivity

**Note**: This app requires the backend server to be running for full functionality. Start the backend with `npm run dev` from the backend directory.
